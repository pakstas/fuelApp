## About The App 
Fuel App is a static web app. This app main purpose was to code working car fuel costs and mileage monitoring solution for casual car owners. 

Basic User can:
- Register and login to system
- Add and edit cars
- Add, edit, remove fuel topups
- Monitor average bought fuel price and average fuel consumption of this car

## Screenshots 

## Technologies 
I used primary `html`, `css`, `vue.js`.
Under the hood I had to use `bulma-css`, `firebase/auth`, `firebase/firestore`, `responsive design` techniques.


## Setup 
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run serve`


## Status 
Fuel Consumption App is only a showcase and it can only be a beginning of a bigger project.
